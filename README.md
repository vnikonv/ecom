### Objective
The goal of this assignment is to design and develop a web-based e-commerce service using Node.js and PostgreSQL
on top of the functioning Java application built in the previous assignment.
In our work, we emphasize web service design, API development, and database integration using modern backend technologies.
#### Requirement Analysis
The application must store and retrieve data using PostgreSQL, handle requests and responses in JSON format,
use appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and status codes. Additionally, a simple front-end web interface
should be made to interact with the application. In testing the application, we will send queries to the server queries using curl.
